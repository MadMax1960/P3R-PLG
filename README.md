Download the code as a zip and install as plugin blender, usage should be very self explanatory after that for import/export. Vertex colors are used, reference vanilla plgs for how they work. 

Make sure you use your exported json with Rirurin's Tool here https://github.com/rirurin/plgtool/releases unless you are exporting to ue itself.
